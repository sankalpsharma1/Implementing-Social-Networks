1. Emregence of Connectedness.

2. Finding Communities using brute force method.

3. Detecting communities using Girwann algorithm.

4. Fatman evolutionary method.

5. Schelling model implementation.

6. Signed network implementation.

7. Points Distribution method.

8. Random walk method.

9. Barabassi Elbert model.

10. Erdos renyi model.

11. Cascading behavior 4 main points:

11.1. Payoff.
11.2. Key people.
11.3. Impact on cascading.
11.4. Cascading clusters.
